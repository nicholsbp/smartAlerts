# smartAlerts
Extremely minimal SMART monitoring script for homelab enviroment. Does not require any additional software or dependancies. By default, this will query all disks in the system for wear and reallocated sector counts. Values surpassing configured thresholds will prompt an smtp alert. This should be deployed as a scheduled task.
